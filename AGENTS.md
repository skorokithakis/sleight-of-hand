# Sleight of hand


## Code concerns

- `pulse_index` should never be reset, except by the `start` MQTT command.

## Documentation maintenance

- Add and remove tasks from `TODO.md` as work is completed or new work is identified.
  Mark completed sections clearly so we can differentiate between what's done and what
  still needs to be done.


## AGEMTS.md file hygiene

Change the AGENTS.md file to add relevant information that fulfills the following
requirements:

* Does it change future behavior? (preference, boundary, recurring pattern)
* Is it a commitment with consequences? (deadline, deliverable, follow-up)
* Is it a decision with rationale? (why X over Y, worth preserving)
* Is it a stable fact that will matter again? (not transient, not obvious)
* Did the user explicitly say "remember this"?

If at least one of the above is true, save the information here, in the "Saved
information" section.
